## Overview

The goal was to replicate the webpage with my style of approach

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

I started with HTML structure and the proceeded to the CSS whereby I styled it based on the 1440px screen size first. Then I styled it for the 375px optimal screen size.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

How to fully maximize parent factor or classes

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.outer-div .inner-div div:hover {
  opacity: 1;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to learn more of pseudo classes
